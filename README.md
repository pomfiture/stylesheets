# stylesheets

Ok fine whatever, I'm done dealing with hosting companies and VPSs and Let's Encrypt and all that bullshit. I'm gonna go full github from here on out because I just want something that works for more than 3 days at a time or whatever. All my edits and my OC (logos, color schemes, etc...) are MIT or WTFPL or whatever. I don't care. I don't think you'll make a dime off this shit. The layouts and such are copyright their creators. Thanks to HTRD for "letting" me use and abuse his lovely layout, and letting me sully it and make it look like some shitty Pharma intranet. Thanks to all the posters for bringing me back. Never Stop Posting. 

Cheers,
Pom
